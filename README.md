## About

This is my final project for CS510 "Intro to Web Development". Plan is to create simple and responsive personal website using HTML,CSS, Bootstrap with Javascript and Jquery. Currently, the plan is to deploy the website using GitHub.

## Development journal

- Spent time reviewing the project description and writing notes so that I donâ€™t miss out on any requirements of this project. I also reviewed the example websites to get the idea on how others approached this project as well to potentially get some design ideas.
- I created the starter files and then spent some time reviewing the Bootstrap Navbar documentation. I've learned the hard way that the `data` has been changed to `data-bs` in Bootstrap V5. I've created a navbar that I believe will suffice for now. I will look up some tutorials on navbar toggler animation and potentially implement that. Next big thing that I will work on will be general design which includes choosing font and color palette.
- After evaluating a few different layout options for the section area I've decided to go with bootstrap containers. Because of my navbar size, and position being fixed on top, I had to set the start of the main container to maximum padding and margin. That might have caused navbar links not to work correctly all of the time. I will need to look into that.
- I decided to try various different fonts from google fonts and decided to, for now, stick with M1 Plus Code. I also spent some time trying different color palettes. After I've found the combination that I like, I applied it to the website using CSS.
